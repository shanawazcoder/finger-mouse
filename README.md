# finger-mouse
Finger Mouse is a simple Python project that uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to control your computer cursor with hand gestures. Move the cursor using your index finger and perform clicks by bringing your thumb close. It runs in real time using a webcam and requires no extra hardware, making gesture-based control easy to try and explore.
